</ul>
<p class="p"> Below you can find information from which you will learn about this unique material , get acquainted with the main advantages , and understand how this brick tile differs from other cladding options .</p>

<h4 class="h4"> Production features </h4>
" p"> Clinker is a building material that is obtained by <b> firing refractory clay </b> in a special tunnel kiln at a temperature of 1200 C. Tiles are produced in the same way as clinker bricks - clay purified from impurities is squeezed out of an extruder under high pressure , like toothpaste from a tube . Next, a special thread is used to cut the tiles into a given format , then they are dried and baked in an oven for two to three days . At the same time, the tiles are not inferior to brick in their physical characteristics - impressive moisture absorption rates of 3% and the number of frost resistance cycles of 250 make this material especially strong and durable .</p>
<p class="p"> There is a <b> cardinal difference </b> in the production of products from refractory and ordinary , in particular , Russian clay . From ordinary types of clay you can make ceramics , i.e. To . it , unlike refractory , has a different composition and its maximum firing temperature will be no more than 800 C. Ceramics are inferior to clinker in strength and durability . The range of clinker tiles for facades is very rich and amounts to several hundred different options . All are different in color , surface and format , which you can view on our website .</p>
<p class="p"> As for visual perception, not a single builder or architect <b> will determine what the façade of the building is faced with - brick or tile </b>. After all, visually we see only the surface . Modern building mixtures make it possible to glue tiles in such a way that their tear strength will be high , and the layer of clinker with adhesive mortar will be even stronger in its mass than solid ceramic bricks .</p>
<h2 class="h2"> Clinker tiles for the facade - price per m2 in Moscow </h2>
<p class="p"> The price per m 2 of clinker tiles for facades imported to Russia <b> ranges from 50 to 150 euros </b> per square meter . The cost is determined by two factors - production and transportation costs . Since deposits of refractory clay suitable for clinker production are not found in Russia, all products are supplied from Germany and Poland . Production is very energy-intensive - huge volumes of gas and electricity are consumed . Prices for most items are set in euros , invoices are issued at the rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the day of payment . However, the cost does not include consumables , such as special solutions for laying and filling joints . Also important <b> factors influencing the price are format and surface </b>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet"> Thus , tiles of standard NF format 240*71 mm will cost much less than those whose sizes have exclusive parameters - for example, for the exquisite series Riegel50 or Glanzstueck with a length of 440-490 mm you will have to pay up to 150 euros / m 2 .</li>
<li class="bullet"> If the surface is smooth and even - i.e. e . nothing was used in manufacturing to give a unique appearance , such tiles will cost less than an aged or glazed front side .</li>
<ul>
<p class="p"> Clinker tiles for facades were first brought to Russia in the early 90s . Since then, it has gained popularity and is rightfully considered one of the best options for external cladding . Whereas in Europe it has already become widespread since the 1980s . years _ It was originally created and used where standard format facing bricks cannot be used - for example, when reconstructing facades and insulating buildings . But over time, it won the hearts of developers with its appearance , ease of installation and price , which is lower than the cost of solid or slotted clinker bricks .</p>
    
<h4 class="h4"> Analogues of clinker tiles for facades </h4>
<p class="p"> Today, brick-like façade tiles are found in <b> several types </b>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b> Clinker </b> - has a lot of different variations in color and surface . Relatively expensive when compared with domestic ceramics , which are inferior in appearance and strength . <b> The service life is several decades </b> without changing the color shade . Durable in terms of maintaining the original appearance . Cost from 50 euros / m2 .</li>
<li class="bullet"><b> Artificial stone </b> is also inferior in appearance . These are vibropressed concrete tiles to which chemical color pigments are added . The characteristics will be comparatively lower due to moisture absorption of up to 10%, or even higher . Over time, such tiles <b> will fade and become covered with small cracks </b>. Whereas for clinker, the moisture absorption rate varies within 3-6%, because of this it almost does not absorb water and temperature differences have little effect on it . Concrete tiles can be bought for less than 1000 rubles / m2 .</li>
<li class="bullet"><b> Porcelain tile </b>, but this material is unsuitable for use on the facade . It <b> lacks vapor permeability </b>. Steam passes through the walls , encountering such a surface, steam can pass through the seams , but will still tend to pass through the tiles . The result will be cracks throughout the entire surface . Clinker is a particularly durable material , but quite vapor-permeable , as it has a unique pore structure .</li>
</ul>
<p class="p"> In addition to the above materials for facade cladding, there are also a lot of cheaper materials such as plaster , paint , siding and various types of panels . As you can see , today there are a lot of options for exterior decoration , so why do clinker tiles for facades deserve your choice ?</p>

<h2 class="h2"> Why is it worth buying clinker tiles for the facade ? </h2>
<p class="p"><b> The first </b> thing you need to pay attention to is the appearance . A rich assortment of colors and textures from hundreds of options will satisfy the requirements of the most sophisticated connoisseur of a brick facade . The variety and unique depth of shades fascinates and leaves an indelible impression of the colorfulness and play of color . Klinker.VIP company specialists will be happy to assist if you want to buy clinker tiles for the facade .</p>
<p class="p"><b> Second </b> is excellent quality . Clinker has tremendous resistance to adverse atmospheric factors - such as sunlight , precipitation , wind, and is also an excellent anti-vandal agent . This means that the facade will remain in its original condition for many years . The durability and durability of the appearance is confirmed year after year on houses where this type of cladding was chosen . The quality is also confirmed by laboratory tests , such as frost resistance , moisture absorption , and bending strength . The service life is more than 100 years , and in insulation systems based on expanded polystyrene foam or mineral wool it is about 50 years , depending on the level of installation work .</p>
<p class="p"><b> Third </b> - unpretentiousness . The surface remains unchanged for many years . There is no need to update the walls , and there is no need for touch-up painting or repairs . Even the most textured tiles , with recesses and recesses , and filled with toppings , do not become dirty for many years . If , for example , minor stains from rain splashes are found in the basement of a building , they can easily be removed with a high-pressure washer ( for example, “Kärcher” ).</p>
<p class="p"> Yes , you will agree - this is a worthy cladding option that you should stop at . But what do you need to know when choosing clinker for a facade , and how , besides color, does it differ ?</p>

<h4 class="h4"> Clinker tiles for facade : important parameters </h4>

<ul>
<li class="bullet"><b> Color </b>: for ease of selection and site navigation, we have conditionally divided the entire color gamut into several separate color groups . Going to a page with , for example , brown clinker , you will see at least several variations of this color , with different surfaces and shades . Why are there no green tiles or bright red tiles ? As mentioned above , this product is based on special types of clay , which can be of different colors . Mostly red is common in various versions - with carbon deposits , with a white coating , differing in shade - from light to dark . But you can also find gray , close to black , sand and other colors . Why can artificial stone be almost white , but clinker tiles for facades have a maximum light shade close to ivory , slightly beige ? The fact is that only natural coloring pigments are used in production . A simple rule applies: whatever color the clay is based on , that’s what the tile will be . However, the shade is adjusted during production . Other clays , sometimes iron oxide , are added to the main composition , and the temperature is adjusted . Technological subtleties are used in terms of supplying heat and oxygen to the tunnel oven .</li>
<li class="bullet"><b> Shade </b>: clinker is based on refractory clay - it is a natural material . It is safe to say that a facade made in this style is unique , since the color always “plays” on the facade . Shade may vary slightly from batch to batch . On the one hand , you can be sure that even if your neighbors have the same brick tiles of the same article, the color of the walls in the overall volume will always be slightly different ( including the type of masonry , the color of the joint ). On the other hand, how can you protect yourself from purchasing a color scheme that is half a tone different from the one for which the money was paid ? This is done by simply laying out on the front of the box the batch of the exact batch that is currently in the warehouse . We are always happy to provide such a service free of charge , so you will make an unmistakable choice .</li>
<li class="bullet">
<b> Surface </b>: on our site there are several types of surfaces , mainly they can be divided into :
class ="bullet--two"> Smooth - follows from the name , i.e. e . smooth , regular geometric shape , but not slipping , matte .</li>
<li class="bullet--two"> Relief - with all kinds of notches and depressions , sometimes with sprinkling . Rough to the touch </li>
<li class="bullet--two"> Aged - the same as embossed , only the edges will already be torn off . Imitates antique brickwork .</li>
<li class="bullet--two"> Premium is a special type that is not included in any of the above descriptions . It is characterized not only by a special type of surface , but also includes some new products from the series of recent years .</li>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="p"> It is worth mentioning separately about glazed tiles . Such a surface will be smooth , almost sliding , and the base will always be clay of red or white varieties . This outer glassy coating contains silicate fusible compounds that sinter with the base and form a durable shiny layer . Thanks to this layer , depending on the angle of incidence of the sun's rays , the color of the walls shimmers . One gets the feeling that at different times of the day and when the weather changes, the building constantly changes its appearance , like a chameleon , but within the same basic color scheme .</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet--two"><b> Format </b>: if you want to buy clinker tiles for the facade , you will understand that the most common is the NF format 240*71 mm . There are variations in tile thickness from 8 mm to 17 mm . The thickness is determined by the technological features of production , for example, an aged surface cannot be produced in a thickness of 8 mm . Consumption is approximately 48 pieces / m2 , including the seam . The weight depends on the thickness , so the weight of 9 mm tiles will be 17.5 kg / m2 , 14 mm will be 25 kg / m2 . Sometimes the tiles are supplied double and built on the end side and are never separated in advance . This can be done without difficulty right before installation work . There are also other formats that are less popular in Russia , these are DF 240*52, WDF 210*65 and others , we will not focus on them , since by and large these are custom-made items . We also have long tiles .</li>
<li class="bullet--two"><b> Seam </b>: according to the recommendations of manufacturers, the seam should be 10-12 mm , tiles are always sold taking this parameter into account . That is , if you need 100 m2 , this means that you will need 4800 pieces of NF- format tiles , taking into account a 10-12 mm seam . In reality , if you glue closely , this amount will not be enough for the specified volume . This is done for reasons of aesthetics and vapor transmission . Bricks are always laid taking into account the seam ; visually it looks much more impressive , and the presence of space between the tiles will make it easier for water vapor to pass through the wall . Although the clinker itself copes well with this task , this will serve as an excellent help .</li>
<li class="bullet--two"><b> Seam color </b>: can significantly change color perception . There are a great variety of grout mixtures on the market , but we recommend purchasing special colored elastic solutions for filling joints for clinker tiles for facades . The so-called “grout” is selected taking into account several factors . For example , how will the mortar contrast with the tiles on the facade , should the main color be highlighted , or, on the contrary, should this not be done . The answer to this question can be quickly obtained by laying out a demo sample and applying various grouts to it to make a choice on one . Elasticity in the solution is achieved by adding certain plasticizers , which make it possible to achieve high values of physical characteristics , such as adhesion and frost resistance . A good solution for filling joints almost does not change its original color over the years , microcracks do not form on it and it is convenient to work with such a solution .</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="h4"> What you need to know about installation </h4>
<p class="p"> By and large, this is all you need to know before buying , without going into details . Our specialists will always provide the necessary advice regarding clinker tiles for the facade , and will also help you accurately select the color scheme, taking into account the color of other elements of the house . Such as roofing , plinth , window frames , and taking into account the characteristics of the land plot . However, it is necessary , among other things , to mention the installation process . Properly installed tiles on the facade of a building will protect you from potential problems and will not make you disappointed . The cost of components and installation will undoubtedly increase the overall cost , but there is no escape from this and in no case should you save on it . By contacting our company , in addition to professional calculation of materials - the amount of row and corner clinker tiles for the facade , we also provide calculation of related materials . Basically this is a special elastic glue and grout mixture for seams , but other things may also be needed . For example, a solution for leveling the base - it all depends on the condition and suitability of the walls of the building for cladding .</p>
<p class="p"> The facade of the building, made in European brick style, is rightfully a masterpiece of architecture . This external appearance of the house emphasizes the refined taste of the owner and reflects his individuality . The inviolability and strength of such a structure is reminiscent of the strength and inaccessibility of a fortress in which medieval noblemen spent their lives and held ceremonial receptions . The durability of such a building will last for more than one generation . By choosing clinker for a brick, you seem to be dressing your home in exclusive , expensive and chic clothes that you will never want to change .</p>

<h1 class="h1"> Clinker tiles FELDHAUS KLINKER</h1>
class ="p"> German plant Feldhaus Klinker ( Feldhaus Klinker ) since 1981 . produces clinker tiles for bricks of the highest level , thanks to which over the past 40 years the business has grown into a large international company with representative offices in more than 30 countries . Moreover, Russia is one of the key markets for product sales , because our climate causes significant damage to buildings , and the use of tiles as a facing material serves as good protection . In total, about 140 chic colors are produced , the permanent warehouse program in Moscow includes 68 color solutions in the NF 240 * 71 * 14 mm format , the price starts from 23.99 euros m 2, for each article there is a corner element .</p>

<h2> Review of Feldhaus Klinker façade tiles </h2>
<p class="p"> The SINTRA series has gained particular popularity , which imitates hand molding and visually represents aged brick . Characterized by torn edges and rough surface . Looking at it, one gets the impression of the durability of the building , because no matter how many hundreds of years nature has tried to change the facade of such a building, the most it can do is leave its traces on it . Today 26 colors are produced , from light cream to dark brown and anthracite shades . There are 17 colors in stock in Moscow in NF format, 14 mm .</p>
<p class="p"> The VASCU series from the Feldhaus Klinker plant represents 39 beautiful colors made in one type of surface - water strokes . As if carved by water from top to bottom , the surface is covered with small stripes . It also resembles the appearance of a century ago , but unlike Sintra it has smooth edges . Here you can select quite a few shades for every taste - from monochromatic to brightly variegated , with combinations of several colors , for example R769NF14 - on a red base you can find dark cinnamon soot and a yellow coating . 12 colors are available in the Moscow warehouse in NF format, 14 mm .</p>
<p class="p">GALENA attracts with its even and smooth surface , based on red clay covered with engobe . A facade covered with such tiles is discreet , but at the same time individual and attractive , thanks to the play of color in the sun . The series is presented in 6 colors , 5 of which are always available in Moscow in the NF 240*71*14 mm format . </p>
<p class="p"> Revival of a surface that was once considered substandard . The CARBONA and SALINA series go hand in hand in embodying the idea of molten firing on the front surface of the tile . When baking in an oven, a technology is used that resembles a uniform supply of oxygen balls - when confronted with a tile , the fire exceeds the average temperature and leaves its mark on the clay . Similar to the Galena series, however, it is distinguished by rough dark spots on the front side of the tile . Available in 9 colors , in stock , one item R560NF14 is available for shipment right now .</p>
<p class="p"> Chasing , or in translation ACCUDO is also similar to GALENA, but it is distinguished by small dents on the surface , as if from chasing . Very expressive shades play beautifully in the sun , and seem to completely change colors when it rains . Available in three colors in Moscow , in NF format , 14 mm .</p>
<p class="p"> The Feldhaus Klinker plant is innovative and is always ready to offer completely new color solutions to the most demanding needs . So , in 2016 VARIO and BACCO appeared . Unlike the above series , 16 striking colors represent the uniqueness and unsurpassed appearance , beauty of clinker tiles , created with the participation of the world's best architects and designers . Currently available for order from Germany in NF format in a thickness of 14 mm , not supported in stock in Moscow .</p>
<p class="p"> Closes this review of the manufacturer Feldhaus Clinker CLASSIC - one of the first series , produced in a thickness of 9 mm , about 30 colors of the NF format are available for shipment in Moscow . The most budget option of all presented , however, this does not mean a lower level of product quality . After all , all series are made from clays of a certain characteristic , i.e. e . the tile itself will be durable , but in such thicknesses surfaces with the effect of aged brick are not produced - but there are a lot of chic solid colors and variegated shades .</p>

<h2 class="h2"> History of the Feldhaus Klinker plant</h2>
<p class="p"> The founding date is considered to be 1857 , when the hereditary farmer Bernhardt Feldhaus in the German city of Bad Laer commissioned a small enterprise for the production of clay bricks . At that time, production was significantly different from modern production, and no one produced tiles for facades . Almost all the work was done manually , and energy costs were simply enormous compared to current ones . The clay was mined with shovels and picks , then it was cleaned and kneaded using a rotary mill to give the desired consistency . Then , using simple forms , the brick was given the desired proportions and size , and sent to dry for several weeks in the open air . Since the beginning of the 19th century, coal has been used as fuel .</p>
<p class="p"> Bernhardt Feldhaus in 1868 decided to modernize his enterprise and built a large ring furnace . According to the instructions of local authorities, the plant had to be located away from cultivated land and residential buildings , and in order to avoid fire and smoke, the chimney had to be at least 15 meters high . The new furnace functioned properly for almost 100 years .</p>
<p class="p"> At first, the products were in demand exclusively among private homeowners , but with rare exceptions, deliveries were also made for public needs . This is how St. Mary 's Church was built in Bad Laer in 1874 . made of Feldhaus Klinker brick . The company gradually increased volumes and improved production technology , so in 1929 a conveyor for automatically adding coal to the furnace was put into operation , and in 1939 a 60- meter long drying tunnel was put into operation .</p>
<p class="p"> However, the company began using more modern equipment in 1966 , with the construction of a 78- meter -long tunnel furnace ; ten years later it was extended to 113 meters . Here the firing process could be controlled and the production process became less labor intensive . New press machines were installed that compressed the clay , giving it strength characteristics ; their productivity for that time was colossal and amounted to 8,000 bricks / hour ( currently more than 20,000 bricks / hour ). However, a real breakthrough can be considered in 1981 , when the Feldhaus Klinker plant began producing brick-like façade clinker tiles . At that time, there were 35 employees , the plant consumed 70,000 tons of clay per year , more than three million cubic meters of natural gas , 1.8 million kilowatt / hour of electricity .</p>
<p class="p"> In the early 2000s , production was equipped with high-precision computer sensors that allow monitoring humidity , temperature of the composition being fired , and setting material supply programs . New types of front surface are emerging , which are achieved through the use of special rollers .</p>
